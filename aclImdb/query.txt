The DiscoverDigital program is our foundational learning journey to drive consistency in digital and necessary data literacy across Sanofi. As a company we have increasingly greater expectations.
Hence, it will be essential that are able to move to the forefront of this transformation and commit to prioritize our upskilling in data, digital, and technology in particular where we want to advance with our customers.

As you know, we launched this program in early 2021 and over this last 1.5 years, we have so far achieved 19.8% active learner rate (learners who have completed >1 lesson or more) and a mere 4% total completion rate for our Courses 1-3 across the global Sanofi enterprise.

For 2023, the DiscoverDigital EXCEL (***E*levate X-GBU Completion of Every Lesson) initiative is being brought in to enable focused strategic engagement between global and local teams. It also shall provide an opportunity to signifcantly accelerate our momentum and reach a positive tipping point, with more support and focus to our top 12 countries (by number of employees) and the specific business teams across the GBUs – Marketing, Medical, and Business Operations.

We have new and ambitious 55%-80% completion learning targets for Q1-Q2 2023 for having completed all 3 courses on Digital Transformation, The Agile Mindset, and the Power of data, to help drive and influence our transformation and increase uptake of digital capability across Sanofi.

Over the course of the next weeks you will see more and more communication and support on DiscoverDigital Excel. Beyond our focus on top 12 countries in employees to start with, we invite each and everyone to join in to that aspirational effort.

Maximize the product value! That’s the Product Owner’s mission; yet, many fail to achieve this.

The Product Owner role is like the Scrum definition. Simple to understand, difficult to master.

You can’t be a good Product Owner without understanding Product Management principles. Without following Product Management practices, Scrum can’t meet its promise of delivering products of the highest possible value.

The session covered many of product management practices like product vision, product roadmap, managing stakeholders , prioritization techniques, Creating Product backlog, user stories and ended it with a Product owner's own learning roadmap.
Hope to see many successful product owners in the Sanofi community.
The outcomes of these sessions are for a Product owner to get the ultimate experience of day to day work and how best to do it.

The Digital Agile COE (DACoE) recently facilitated a general awareness session on “Business Agility using Kanban” for the Specialty Care International & China Medical Affairs Leadership Team, in awe-inspiring, fascinating Istanbul. In the initial moments of the session, it was apparent challenges faced in Real World Generation processes (and other Medical Affairs processes) are akin to those experienced in Digital: too much work, people are over-burdened, forecasts are not predictable enough, unable to keep commitments, things take much longer to deliver, quality issues drive up failure load/rework, exceeding budgets, lack of customer orientation, etc.

The 3.5 hour session was anchored by the Kanban pizza game, first round to introduce principles (start with what you do now, pursue improvement through evolutionary change, encourage acts of leadership at all levels), followed by gradual introduction of practices in subsequent rounds (visualize workflow, limit work in progress, manage flow, make policies explicit, establish feedback loops, improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally)

The Kanban Method, succinctly described by its founders as the “alternative path to agility” is a social and psychological means to achieving business agility. No one gets a new identity; there is no re-organization of people into pods, squads, mobs, chapters, guilds, tribes, packs or herds. Start with what you do now, gain agreements to pursue improvement through evolutionary change, identify the biggest bottleneck, do something about it, repeat.

DACoE’s messaging is to start with the Kanban principles and evolving practices commensurate with the maturity of the team.

Ziad, Lilya /AE, ILLERA BARTOLOME, Angela /IT/EXT, Roushdy, Sherif /AE and other LT members, we hope we were able to light a spark in your thought processes about business agility and how you could start kanbanizing your processes, one by one, using STATIK framework. I took the liberty of including some pictures here. Please feel to comment and know that the DACoE is here to support you on your agile journey.

All others interested in learning more, please feel free to review the training material, activities and the online pizza game, on the Miro board:

Alternatively, attached is a PDF of the Miro board (excluding activities and Kanban pizza game)

Furthermore, if you would like the DACoE to facilitate a session with your team to gain a better understanding of the Kanban method and if it is appropriate for your service delivery processes and/or software development processes, please do not hesitate to respond to this post.

Imagination has no boundaries in Digital Health!

Here is a new approach of non-invasive blood glucose measurement.

The idea is to use your breath biomarkers to deduce your blood glucose level. Researchers at Canada’s University of Waterlooin association with Brazilian startup OrientaMED created a breath analyzer device that uses gas sensors to measure breath and detect biomarkers. This will allow people with diabetes to get it over with multiple daily finger pricks ….
Though there has been promising research showing that chemical compounds in human breath can be used to diagnose diseases, reveal environmental exposures, and detect metabolic activity.

As of today, this is only a proof of concept but it will be very soon backed by clinical trials.

What is eSASL technology?
This digital packaging authentication technology uses an e-fingerprint technology (eSASL) to replace the existing paper security label (SASL).
To detect potential suspicious products, the Act4Health mobile app(on App Store, Play Store) was set up to allow Sanofians* and mainly #salesforces, #quality, #supplychain and #security to check packaging authenticity on their personal or professional smartphones. Today, the app is restricted to Sanofians, but the program team is assessing the extension to consumers.

What are the immediate benefits for our company?
· A sustainable solution: no more labels, no more shipments, lower carbon footprint
· Acceleration of the packaging line process
· 80% savings compared to the SASL price

Where do we stand?
With eSASL already implemented on GenMed (Plavix®, Multaq®) and CHC (Cialis® - production not yet started) products, Vaccines has decided to join this project and will come on board in 2023.

Learn more about why and how we protect our products:

It felt terrific to see use cases of process mining growing at Sanofi. How you can't, when you considered this digital service your baby and were involved in overseeing it incept and grow into a digital offering from a mere idea? The potential is enormous as it continues to seep deeper into the fabrics of our core processes. Kudos to the team and my ex-colleagues Barbara Baron and Christophe Bonche for their dedication and continued effort to this hidden gem. Way to go!

Wishing more success in the coming days via process mining and intelligence. I hope the following article I wrote, during my days with process mining, further sheds light on what's possible as we continue to venture into digital health via process mining with data at the core - Sustaining Digital Health Business Models Through Process Intelligence-~ blog by Sudhir Shandilya (openovation.co)<https://openovation.co/digital-health-business-model-process-intelligence/>

Beginning on October 29th, the ServiceNow system will run a weekly audit of the Service Portfolio to find inactive users identified in the “Owned by” field of service records. Inactive or Blank ownership puts operational activities at risk. Service records flagged in this audit will have the ""Owned by"" field populated with the active user identified in the parent record ""Owned by"" field.

How can I see if I'm going to be impacted by this audit?
See spreadsheet attached to this post or use ServiceNow report (SPM: Missing Ownership by New owner<https://sanofiservices.service-now.com/sys_report_template.do?jvar_report_id=1082a6ed1bbe1950e3fd20e23b4bcb91>)

Can I see all the service records that I own in one place?
Yes - Service Management User Dashboard<https://%3Chttps/sanofiservices.service-now.com/$pa_dashboard.do?sysparm_dashboard=baed9b35db1ed9583d9764d60596197c&sysparm_tab=32a5db2e1b6d1d10e3fd20e23b4bcba3&sysparm_cancelable=true&sysparm_editable=undefined&sysparm_active_panel=false%3E>

How will you know if you've been impacted by this audit?
""New"" owners and their service catalog manager of the updated records will be sent a system notification of the change.

How can I see if a record was updated through this automation?
Records updated by the system audit will have a timestamped worknote indicating the activity.

What should I do if I have inherited ownership of a service that should belong to someone else?
Option A: The ""Owned by"" attribute can be updated directly in the form by the resources identified as:
* Owned by
* Managed by
* Service Catalog Manager (only with ServiceNow SCM role permissions)

Option B: Submit Request creation or modification of an IT Solution and supporting service offerings<https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsanofiservices.service-now.com%2Fits%3Fid%3Drequest_order_guide%26sys_id%3Df28791d3db583740bb471923059619c2&data=04%7C01%7CAndrea.Botto%40sanofi.com%7C0fd773b83bb149bf7e3e08d88575e2e5%7Caca3c8d6aa714e1aa10e03572fc58c0b%7C0%7C0%7C637406088652449112%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=m7dTIO40u7eFLgrL6%2BuunkyGqLZpM08hY0asBz0knAE%3D&reserved=0>

On behalf of the Sanofi Architecture COEs, we're happy to announce a special treat for the digital community.

The Architecture teams across all digital units have teamed up to bring you a comprehensive architecture portal<https://docs.sanofi.com/architecture/undefined/63823649942>. It's a one-stop shop for guidelines, standards, and technical tools to support your products and solutions.

Don’t spend time inventing tricky solutions which will haunt support teams for years when you could find simple, resilient, and re-usable patterns.

A team of knowledgeable technologists is here to support their implementation.
You’ll learn about how to engage with the architecture COEs, our renewed manifesto<https://docs.sanofi.com/architecture/common/60467430731>, and all the ADRs (architecture decision records), including those in draft.

And, who knows, you might have as well a few spooky obsolete applications – we’re to help chasing technical debt.

Some sections in the portal are still in development, we’ll welcome your feedback as you’re discovering it, as an opportunity for continuous improvement and incremental value."

""The Big Wednesday"" movie was good, but should have been better.

The director was John Milius, who himself was a surfer (it is him in the photo when the credits show his name). Milius also directed ""Conan the Barbarian"", ""Red Dawn"" and was the main scriptwriter for ""Apocalypse Now""), where there is a little surfing scene while the US troops are attacking and the famous ""Charlie don't surf"" is said (no, this was not created by The Clash for ""Sandinista!"").

And the voice over in the beginning is done by Robert Englund (also acting in the movie, but better known as Freddy Krueger)."	Item	sites/CollaborationApplicationTeam/Lists/sentiment_analysis1993977873924096	positive	"Jaleel, Khalid /US this is great! I will coordinate the conversation! Best!

The running joke, which MB also jokes about, is that he only comes out at Christmas. I recently took a trip to Vancouver so that my wife and daughter could see him in concert (they are big fans). It's that time of year, and he is definitely active again. Good holiday cheer, and throughout the year. Enjoy!"	Item	sites/CollaborationApplicationTeam/Lists/sentiment_analysis
